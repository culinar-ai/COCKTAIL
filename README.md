# COCKTAILS
Project COCKTAILS takes advantage of the fact that ratios are the basis for most cocktails.
FiveThirtyEight used k-means to [cluster margarita recipes](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/we-got-drunk-on-margaritas-for-science/) in 2017, which I thought was absolutely brilliant.

I believe that similar methods can be used to cluster other popular cocktail types,
and if I have to take one for the team and test out each one at one of my favorite DC cocktail bars, I guess I'll have to bite that bullet.
